Project 2a:
    - Implemented the load command by calling the provided
    library functions in load() in SqlEngine.cc

Project 2b:
    - Implemented the BTreeNode and BTreeNonLeafNode classes

Project 2c:
    - Implemented the BTreeIndex class

Work Split:
    - 50/50 - pair programmed the entire thing
    - 50/50 - we split up the work evenly and each finished implementing one class
    - 50/50 - we split up the work evenly and implemented half the class each
    - Team dynamic is great right now
