Names: Max Chern | Ryan Peterman
UID:   304290221 | 704269982

Overall Method:
    1. Used GET request with text area to grab input text
    2. Sent input text to mysql database using PHP
    3. Displayed result back to user

On the mysql side we made sure the data was prepared properly
with the correct create.sql and load.sql script.

Work Split:
    We each did 50% as we pair programmed the entirety of the project.
